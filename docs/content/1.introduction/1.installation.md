# Overview

`vue3-lottie` was created to help developers add Lottie animations to their Vue 3 applications. In my search for a simple way to add Lottie animations to my Vue application I found a suprising lack of maintained solutions. I decided to create my own solution and share it with the community.

`vue3-lottie` is a vue wrapper around the `lottie-web` library with a few additional features. Typescript support has been added to make it easier to use.

`vue3-lottie` is not a full-featured Lottie library. It is only a wrapper around the `lottie-web` library. It does not support all of the features of the `lottie-web` library.
