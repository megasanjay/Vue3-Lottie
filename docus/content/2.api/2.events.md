# Events

`vue3-lottie` will also emit the following events as they are described in the [lottie-web documentation](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web#events). Look at the examples provided in the [examples section](/examples#listening-to-events) for how to use these methods.

## onComplete

If your animation has a **`finite`** amount of loops you can use this event to know when the animation has completed.

## onLoopComplete

If your animation has a **`finite`** amount of loops you can use this event to know when the animation has completed a loop.

[`onLoopComplete demo`](/examples#listening-to-events)

## onEnterFrame

This event is fired at every frame of the animation. There will be 60 events fired per second if your lottie animation runs at 60fps.

## onSegmentStart

This event is fired when the animation enters a segment.

## onAnimationLoaded

This event is fired when the animation has loaded. This should let you know when you can start referencing the methods for the component.

::alert{type="warning"}
Don't use the `mounted` or `onMounted` lifecycle hooks because they will be called before the animation has loaded in the browser. Use the `onAnimationLoaded` event instead.
